  <p class="subtitle">about me and math</p>
  <p>My name is Ian and I’ve never written a book. I really don’t know why I’m writing this book, other than to try and sell it. Which prolly won’t happen because it’ll end up posted online. However…</p>
<p>The fact remains, I feel compelled to. And I do what I want. And I want to tell you about math and cool shit from it. Oh yeah, I’m gonna cuss and not be proper. This isn’t a damn textbook.</p>
<p>Ever since I was little I couldn’t help but notice the inherent structure in the universe I experience. Mother fuckers talk about how probabilities arise and it’s incompatible with linearity, but I just see the universe and my human experience as a big ass casino with a bunch of shit to play that’s a gamble, some of which is just walking through it. No choice in that gamble, that’s existence folks! You do have some choice in the casino of life though. You can run and hide in the hotel bed and not risk anything, you can try different machines and tables of people, and you can cash out. But remember, you always have value in the casino…</p>
<p>Math is fucking dope. You math everyday and you can’t even control it. Your heartbeat=math. Your money=math. Your music=math. It’s all mathematical like Wu Tang wrote it. Even emotions can be mathed up. They call it psychology. They study a group and compare it to other groups and those groups get compared to other groups and it’s all one big ass comparison, then they say this percentage thinks or doesn’t think and/or does or doesn’t do some thing(s) or another. Statistical analysis mother fuckers.</p>
<p>So here we go into a little of the math I see and things that are just cool…</p>
