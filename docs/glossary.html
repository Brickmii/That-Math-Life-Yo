  <p class="subtitle">a cheat sheet for the casino</p>
  <p>Here’s a quick reference for terms and constants you’ll run into throughout this book. Not exhaustive, just enough to get you oriented. Think of it as a cheat sheet for the casino.</p>
<h2>Terms</h2>
<p><strong>Absolute Value – </strong>How far a number is from zero, regardless of direction. Always positive. Think of it as distance, not position.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm – </strong>A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. Recipes are algorithms. So is long division.</p>
<p><strong>Associativity – </strong>The rule that says grouping doesn’t matter: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). Not all operations have this.</p>
<p><strong>Axiom – </strong>A statement accepted as true without proof. The starting rules of any mathematical system. You gotta start somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Base (number systems) – </strong>The number of unique digits in a counting system. We use base 10 (decimal). Computers use base 2 (binary).</p>
<p><strong>Bijection – </strong>A perfect one-to-one pairing between two sets. Every element matches exactly one partner. No leftovers.</p>
<p><strong>Binary – </strong>Base-2 number system using only 0 and 1. The language of computers. On or off, true or false.</p>
<p><strong>Boolean – </strong>A value that’s either true or false. Named after George Boole. The foundation of logic and computing.</p>
<p><strong>Cardinality – </strong>The size of a set. How many elements it contains. Infinity has different cardinalities, which is wild.</p>
<p><strong>Cartesian Plane – </strong>The x-y coordinate grid. Named after Descartes, who connected algebra and geometry by giving shapes equations.</p>
<p><strong>Coefficient – </strong>The number multiplied by a variable. In 3x, the 3 is the coefficient. It scales things.</p>
<p><strong>Commutativity – </strong>The rule that says order doesn’t matter: a + b = b + a. Multiplication has it, division doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Complement – </strong>Everything NOT in a given set. If your set is even numbers, the complement is odd numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Constant – </strong>A fixed value that doesn’t change. Opposite of a variable. Pi and e are famous constants.</p>
<p><strong>Convergence – </strong>When a sequence or series approaches a specific value as it goes on forever. It settles down.</p>
<p><strong>Cosine (cos) – </strong>A trig function. The x-coordinate on the unit circle. The horizontal component of rotation.</p>
<p><strong>Degree – </strong>In angles, a unit of measurement (360 in a full circle). In polynomials, the highest exponent.</p>
<p><strong>Derivative – </strong>The rate of change of a function at any point. How fast something is moving right now. Calculus stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Determinant – </strong>A single number computed from a matrix that tells you about its behavior—whether it flips, scales, or collapses space.</p>
<p><strong>Dimension – </strong>The number of independent directions in a space. A line is 1D, a plane is 2D, our world is 3D. Math goes higher.</p>
<p><strong>Distributive Property – </strong>a(b + c) = ab + ac. Multiplication distributes over addition. One of the most used rules in algebra.</p>
<p><strong>Domain – </strong>The set of all valid inputs for a function. What you’re allowed to plug in.</p>
<p><strong>Element – </strong>A thing inside a set. If the set is {1, 2, 3}, then 2 is an element.</p>
<p><strong>Empty Set (∅) – </strong>The set with nothing in it. The foundation of all of set theory. Zero in set form.</p>
<p><strong>Equation – </strong>A statement that two expressions are equal. The backbone of algebra.</p>
<p><strong>Euler’s Number (e) – </strong>Approximately 2.71828. The base of natural logarithms. Shows up everywhere in growth and decay. One of the most important constants in math.</p>
<p><strong>Exponent – </strong>How many times a number is multiplied by itself. In 2³, the 3 is the exponent.</p>
<p><strong>Factorial (n!) – </strong>n multiplied by every positive integer below it. 5! = 120. Counts the number of ways to arrange things.</p>
<p><strong>Field – </strong>A set with addition and multiplication that both behave nicely—commutative, associative, with identities and inverses.</p>
<p><strong>Function – </strong>A rule that takes an input and gives exactly one output. A mathematical machine.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Ratio (φ) – </strong>Approximately 1.618. Shows up in art, architecture, nature, spirals. It’s the ratio where the whole is to the large part as the large part is to the small.</p>
<p><strong>Graph – </strong>A visual representation of a function or data set. Also, in discrete math, a collection of nodes and edges.</p>
<p><strong>Group – </strong>A set with one operation that’s closed, associative, has an identity, and every element has an inverse. The simplest algebraic structure.</p>
<p><strong>Homeomorphism – </strong>In topology, a continuous deformation between shapes. If you can stretch one into the other without cutting or gluing, they’re homeomorphic.</p>
<p><strong>Hypotenuse – </strong>The longest side of a right triangle. The one across from the 90-degree angle.</p>
<p><strong>Identity – </strong>An element that does nothing under an operation. 0 for addition, 1 for multiplication.</p>
<p><strong>Imaginary Number (i) – </strong>The square root of -1. Doesn’t exist on the number line but is essential for complex numbers, physics, and engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Infinity (∞) – </strong>Not a number. A concept representing something without bound. There are different sizes of infinity.</p>
<p><strong>Integer – </strong>Whole numbers including negatives: ...–2, –1, 0, 1, 2... No fractions, no decimals.</p>
<p><strong>Integral – </strong>The opposite of a derivative. Accumulation. The area under a curve. Calculus’s other big tool.</p>
<p><strong>Intersection (∩) – </strong>The elements that two sets have in common. The overlap.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse – </strong>The element that undoes another. The inverse of 3 under addition is –3. Under multiplication, it’s 1/3.</p>
<p><strong>Irrational Number – </strong>A number that can’t be written as a fraction. Its decimal goes forever without repeating. Pi, e, and √2 are irrational.</p>
<p><strong>Limit – </strong>The value a function approaches as the input gets closer to some point. The foundation of calculus.</p>
<p><strong>Linear – </strong>Relating to a straight line. A linear equation graphs as a line. A linear system plays by proportional rules.</p>
<p><strong>Logarithm – </strong>The inverse of exponentiation. log₂(8) = 3 because 2³ = 8. Asks: what power gets me there?</p>
<p><strong>Matrix – </strong>A rectangular grid of numbers. Used in linear algebra to represent transformations and systems of equations.</p>
<p><strong>Mean (Average) – </strong>Add everything up, divide by how many there are. The center of gravity of a data set.</p>
<p><strong>Median – </strong>The middle value when data is sorted. Less affected by outliers than the mean.</p>
<p><strong>Nash Equilibrium – </strong>In game theory, a state where no player benefits from changing their strategy alone. A stable standoff.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Number – </strong>The counting numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3... (whether 0 counts depends on who you ask).</p>
<p><strong>Null Set – </strong>Same as the empty set. Contains nothing. Often written as ∅ or {}.</p>
<p><strong>Operator – </strong>A symbol representing a mathematical operation. +, –, ×, ÷ are operators. So is d/dx in calculus.</p>
<p><strong>Ordered Pair – </strong>Two values in a specific order, like (x, y). Position matters. (3, 5) is not (5, 3).</p>
<p><strong>Parabola – </strong>The U-shaped curve you get from a quadratic equation. Every thrown ball follows one.</p>
<p><strong>Payoff Matrix – </strong>In game theory, a table showing what each player gets for each combination of strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Pi (π) – </strong>Approximately 3.14159. The ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. Irrational, transcendental, everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Polynomial – </strong>An expression with variables and exponents added together: 3x² + 2x – 5. The workhorses of algebra.</p>
<p><strong>Prime Number – </strong>A number greater than 1 that’s only divisible by 1 and itself. The atoms of arithmetic.</p>
<p><strong>Probability – </strong>A number between 0 and 1 measuring how likely an outcome is. 0 = impossible, 1 = certain.</p>
<p><strong>Proof – </strong>A logical argument that demonstrates a statement is true beyond doubt. The gold standard in math.</p>
<p><strong>Pythagorean Theorem – </strong>a² + b² = c². The relationship between the sides of a right triangle. One of the oldest and most famous results in math.</p>
<p><strong>Radian – </strong>An angle measurement based on the radius of a circle. 2π radians = 360 degrees. Math prefers radians.</p>

<p><strong>Vector – </strong>A quantity with both magnitude and direction. An arrow in space. The building block of linear algebra.</p>
<p><strong>Vertex – </strong>A corner point. Where edges meet in a shape, or the peak/valley of a parabola.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-Sum Game – </strong>A game theory situation where one player’s gain equals the other’s loss. Poker is zero-sum. Trade isn’t.</p>
<h2>Key Constants</h2>
<p><strong>0 (Zero) – </strong>The additive identity. The empty set’s cardinality. The boundary between positive and negative. More important than any other number.</p>
<p><strong>1 (One) – </strong>The multiplicative identity. The successor of zero. The building block.</p>
