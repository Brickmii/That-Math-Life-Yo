  <p class="subtitle">about math and shapes</p>
  <h2>The Oldest Math</h2>
<p>Geometry is old. Like, OLD old. Before algebra had a name. Before zero was a number. People were doing geometry.</p>
<p>Why? Because land exists. &quot;Geometry&quot; literally means &quot;earth measurement&quot;—geo (earth) + metron (measure). You got a field, you need to know how big it is. You&#x27;re building a pyramid, you need the angles right. Geometry is math you can touch.</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s the thing: the ancients didn&#x27;t just measure. They PROVED. They figured out that you could start with a few obvious truths and deduce everything else with pure logic. No measuring required. Just reasoning.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the real gift of geometry. Not shapes—proof. The idea that you can KNOW something is true, not just believe it or measure it approximately. You can demonstrate it with certainty.</p>
<h2>Euclid: The Original System Builder</h2>
<p>Around 300 BCE, a Greek mathematician named Euclid writes a book called <em>Elements</em>. It becomes the most influential textbook in history. For over two thousand years, this is how people learn rigorous thinking.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what Euclid does: he starts with definitions, postulates (assumptions), and common notions (things everyone agrees on). Then he builds. Theorem after theorem, each one proven from the previous ones, all the way back to the starting assumptions.</p>
<p>Five postulates. That&#x27;s the foundation:</p>
<p>You can draw a straight line between any two points.</p>
<p>You can extend a line indefinitely.</p>
<p>You can draw a circle with any center and radius.</p>
<p>All right angles are equal.</p>
<p>If two lines are crossed by a third, and the angles on one side add up to less than 180°, the lines will eventually meet on that side.</p>
<p>The first four are clean. Obvious. The fifth one—the &quot;parallel postulate&quot;—is weird. It&#x27;s clunky. It bothered mathematicians for centuries. More on that later.</p>
<p>From these five assumptions, Euclid derives hundreds of propositions. The Pythagorean theorem. Properties of triangles, circles, polygons. The infinitude of primes. All of it flows logically from five starting points.</p>
<p>This is the template. This is what rigorous mathematics looks like. You state your assumptions clearly, then you show what follows. No hand-waving. No &quot;trust me.&quot; Proof.</p>
<h2>Archimedes: The God-Tier Problem Solver</h2>
<p>Archimedes of Syracuse. 287–212 BCE. If Euclid built the system, Archimedes showed what you could DO with it.</p>
<p>This man figured out the area of a circle, the volume of a sphere, the surface area of a sphere. He calculated pi more accurately than anyone before him. He discovered the principle of buoyancy while sitting in a bathtub and allegedly ran through the streets naked yelling &quot;Eureka!&quot;</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s the move that matters: exhaustion. The method of exhaustion.</p>
<p>You want to find the area of a circle. You can&#x27;t just measure it—circles are curved, your ruler is straight. So what do you do?</p>
<p>Archimedes inscribes a polygon inside the circle. A hexagon, say. He can calculate the hexagon&#x27;s area. It&#x27;s less than the circle&#x27;s area, but close.</p>
<p>Now he doubles the sides. A 12-sided polygon. Closer.</p>
<p>Double again. 24 sides. Closer still.</p>
<p>Keep going. 48 sides. 96 sides. The polygon gets closer and closer to the circle. The area of the polygon approaches the area of the circle.</p>
<p>This is proto-calculus. Two thousand years before Newton and Leibniz, Archimedes is using limits. He&#x27;s approximating curves with straight lines, then taking the approximation to infinity.</p>
<p>The volume of a sphere? Same trick. Fill it with smaller and smaller slices, add them up, take the limit. He proves it&#x27;s (4/3)πr³. Exactly.</p>
<p>When the Romans invaded Syracuse, a soldier killed Archimedes. Supposedly Archimedes was drawing geometric figures in the sand and said &quot;Don&#x27;t disturb my circles.&quot; The soldier didn&#x27;t care. Geometry doesn&#x27;t stop swords.</p>
<h2>Descartes: Where Algebra Meets Geometry</h2>
<p>Jump to 1637. French philosopher René Descartes publishes a book with an appendix called <em>La Géométrie</em>. In it, he does something revolutionary: he puts coordinates on geometry.</p>
<p>Draw two perpendicular lines. Call them x and y. Now every point in the plane can be described by two numbers: how far along x, how far along y. The point (3, 4) means &quot;go 3 units right, 4 units up.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the Cartesian plane. Named after Descartes (Cartesius in Latin).</p>
<p>Why is this a big deal? Because now geometry IS algebra. A circle isn&#x27;t just a shape—it&#x27;s an equation: x² + y² = r². A line isn&#x27;t just something you draw—it&#x27;s y = mx + b.</p>
<p>Every geometric question becomes an algebraic question. Every algebraic relationship becomes a geometric shape. The two fields merge.</p>
<p>Want to find where two curves intersect? Solve their equations simultaneously. Want to understand an equation? Graph it and see the shape.</p>
<p>This is the power of coordinates. You can move back and forth between visual intuition and algebraic manipulation. Whatever&#x27;s easier for the problem at hand.</p>
<h2>Dimension: Flatland and Beyond</h2>
<p>You live in three dimensions. Left-right, forward-back, up-down. Three perpendicular directions. Three coordinates needed to specify your position.</p>
<p>But math doesn&#x27;t care about what you can visualize. Math asks: what if there were more?</p>
<p>A point is zero-dimensional. No length, no width, no height. Just position.</p>
<p>A line is one-dimensional. Length only. One number specifies where you are on it.</p>
<p>A plane is two-dimensional. Length and width. Two numbers (x, y) specify a point.</p>
<p>Space is three-dimensional. Length, width, height. Three numbers (x, y, z).</p>
<p>Now keep going. Four dimensions. Five. A hundred. A million.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t picture it. That&#x27;s fine. You can still do the math. A point in n-dimensional space is just n numbers: (x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ). Distance still works—it&#x27;s the Pythagorean theorem generalized. Shapes still exist—they&#x27;re just defined by equations in more variables.</p>
<h2>Hypercubes and Hyperspheres</h2>
<p>A square is a 2D cube. Four corners, four edges.</p>
<p>A cube is a 3D cube. Eight corners, twelve edges, six faces.</p>
<p>A hypercube (or tesseract) is a 4D cube. Sixteen corners, thirty-two edges, twenty-four faces, eight &quot;cells&quot; (3D cubes as its boundary).</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t visualize it directly. But you can understand it by analogy. A square is what you get when you drag a line segment perpendicular to itself. A cube is what you get when you drag a square perpendicular to itself. A hypercube is what you get when you drag a cube perpendicular to itself—in a direction you can&#x27;t point to because you&#x27;re stuck in 3D.</p>
<p>Same with spheres. A circle is all points at distance r from a center in 2D. A sphere is all points at distance r from a center in 3D. A hypersphere is all points at distance r from a center in 4D.</p>
<p>The formulas generalize. The volume of a hypersphere has a formula. It involves π, the radius, and the dimension. Higher dimensions are just more of the same patterns, extended.</p>
<h2>Polarity Through Dimensions</h2>
<p>Here&#x27;s something that stopped me cold when I saw it.</p>
<p>Take a sphere. It has poles—north and south. That&#x27;s polarity. An orientation. A &quot;which way.&quot;</p>
<p>Now embed that sphere in a higher dimension. Make it the &quot;equator&quot; of a hypersphere, the way a circle is the equator of a regular sphere.</p>
<p>Where&#x27;s north?</p>
<p>Still there. North on the sphere is still north. The polarity isn&#x27;t destroyed by adding a dimension. It&#x27;s retained. The orientation persists.</p>
<p>Go the other way. Take a hypersphere and project it down to a regular sphere (like how a globe projects down to a flat map, but one dimension up). The poles map to poles. The polarity survives the projection.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t obvious. You might expect higher dimensions to scramble everything, to make lower-dimensional orientation meaningless. But they don&#x27;t. Polarity is conserved through dimensional transitions.</p>
<p>Think about what this means. There&#x27;s a thread of orientation that runs through ALL dimensions. North is north is north, whether you&#x27;re on a circle, a sphere, a hypersphere, or something even higher. The &quot;which way&quot; is invariant.</p>
<p>This was, for me, a doorway. If polarity persists through dimensions—if orientation is fundamental rather than emergent—then there&#x27;s structure beneath structure. Something that doesn&#x27;t depend on which dimensional slice you&#x27;re looking at.</p>
<p>Math lets you see this. You can prove that the poles of an n-sphere map to the poles of an (n-1)-sphere under projection. It&#x27;s not mystical. It&#x27;s geometric. But the implication is profound: directionality is woven into reality at every level.</p>
<h2>The Parallel Postulate Problem</h2>
<p>Remember Euclid&#x27;s fifth postulate? The clunky one about parallel lines?</p>
<p>For two thousand years, mathematicians tried to prove it from the other four. They figured it was too complicated to be a true axiom—surely it followed from simpler assumptions.</p>
<p>They failed. Every single attempt failed.</p>
<p>Then, in the 1800s, several mathematicians independently realized why: you CAN&#x27;T prove it from the others. And if you CHANGE it, you get different geometries. Consistent, logical, complete geometries—just not Euclidean.</p>
<h2>Non-Euclidean Geometry: Curved Worlds</h2>
<p>What if parallel lines don&#x27;t work the way Euclid said?</p>
<p><em>Hyperbolic geometry</em>: Through a point not on a line, there are INFINITELY MANY lines parallel to the original. Space curves like a saddle. Triangles have angles that add up to LESS than 180°.</p>
<p><em>Spherical geometry</em>: Through a point not on a line, there are NO parallel lines. All &quot;lines&quot; (great circles) eventually intersect. Triangles have angles that add up to MORE than 180°. You live on this geometry—it&#x27;s the surface of the Earth. That&#x27;s why flat maps distort things.</p>
<p>These aren&#x27;t just mathematical curiosities. They describe real spaces. The surface of a sphere isn&#x27;t flat—it has intrinsic curvature. Hyperbolic space shows up in certain physical systems. Non-Euclidean geometry is geometry of curved surfaces.</p>
<h2>Poincaré: Topology Meets Geometry</h2>
<p>Henri Poincaré. French. Late 1800s, early 1900s. One of the last mathematicians who could work in every field.</p>
<p>Poincaré helped create topology—the study of shapes that doesn&#x27;t care about measurement, only connection. But he also revolutionized geometry by asking: what&#x27;s the shape of a space, globally?</p>
<p>Local geometry tells you what happens in a small neighborhood. A sphere and a plane look the same if you zoom in close enough—both look flat. But globally, they&#x27;re different. The sphere wraps around. The plane doesn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Poincaré studied manifolds—spaces that locally look like ordinary Euclidean space but globally might have weird structure. A torus (donut shape) is a 2D manifold—any small patch looks like a flat plane, but the whole thing wraps around in two different ways.</p>
<p>The Poincaré conjecture asked: if a 3D manifold has a certain property (every loop can be shrunk to a point), is it basically a 3-sphere? This was open for a century. Grigori Perelman proved it in 2003. He turned down the million-dollar prize.</p>
<p>Manifolds matter because the universe might be one. Spacetime isn&#x27;t just empty coordinates—it&#x27;s a manifold with shape, curvature, structure. Which brings us to...</p>
<h2>Einstein: Gravity Is Geometry</h2>
<p>Albert Einstein publishes the general theory of relativity.</p>
<p>The idea: gravity isn&#x27;t a force. Gravity is the curvature of spacetime.</p>
<p>Mass and energy tell spacetime how to curve. Curved spacetime tells matter how to move. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s the whole theory.</p>
<p>The Earth doesn&#x27;t &quot;pull&quot; you down with some invisible force. The Earth&#x27;s mass curves the spacetime around it, and you&#x27;re following the straightest possible path through that curved space—which happens to lead toward the ground.</p>
<p>This requires all the geometry we&#x27;ve built up. Spacetime is a 4D manifold—three space dimensions plus time. It&#x27;s not flat; it&#x27;s curved by the presence of matter and energy. The math is differential geometry—calculus on manifolds.</p>
<p>When Einstein needed to describe curved 4D spacetime, the math already existed. Riemann, building on Gauss, had developed it decades earlier. Einstein learned it and applied it.</p>
<p>This is why math matters even when it seems abstract. Mathematicians developed non-Euclidean geometry and higher-dimensional manifolds because they were curious. Then a physicist needed exactly that machinery to describe gravity. The abstract became concrete.</p>
<h2>Spacetime Curvature</h2>
<p>Here&#x27;s what curved spacetime means:</p>
<p>Near a massive object, time runs slower. Clocks on GPS satellites tick faster than clocks on Earth because they&#x27;re farther from Earth&#x27;s mass, in less-curved spacetime. GPS has to correct for this or your navigation would drift by kilometers.</p>
<p>Near a massive object, space is compressed. Distances are different than you&#x27;d expect from flat geometry.</p>
<p>Black holes are where curvature goes extreme. Spacetime curves so much that nothing—not even light—can escape. The &quot;singularity&quot; at the center is where the curvature becomes infinite. Our equations break down.</p>
<p>This is geometry. Real, physical, measurable geometry. Not just abstract math—the actual shape of the universe.</p>
<h2>Geodesics: The Straightest Path</h2>
<p>In flat space, the shortest path between two points is a straight line.</p>
<p>In curved space, the shortest path is a geodesic. On a sphere, geodesics are great circles—like the equator, or the path an airplane takes between distant cities.</p>
<p>In spacetime, objects follow geodesics unless acted on by a non-gravitational force. The Moon orbits Earth not because Earth is &quot;pulling&quot; it, but because the Moon is following the straightest possible path through the curved spacetime around Earth. That path happens to loop around.</p>
<p>Gravity isn&#x27;t a force in this picture. It&#x27;s geometry. Straight lines in curved space look like curves from a flat perspective.</p>
<h2>Why Geometry Matters</h2>
<p>Geometry starts with land measurement and ends with the shape of the universe. That&#x27;s a hell of a journey.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s all connected. The same impulse—understanding shapes, spaces, structures—scales from a farmer&#x27;s field to a black hole&#x27;s event horizon. The tools get more sophisticated, but the questions are the same: what&#x27;s the shape? How do things fit together? What paths are possible?</p>
<p>And Euclid&#x27;s gift—proof, rigorous deduction from axioms—applies at every level. You don&#x27;t have to take anyone&#x27;s word for it. You can verify. You can KNOW.</p>
<p>Shapes aren&#x27;t just pictures. They&#x27;re structure. And structure is what math is about.</p>
